## electronic music 1996 - 2001

The official release of my [Scream Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_Tracker) songs.

I did all of them on a 386 SX with 4mb of memory, although the ScreamTracker did only use the 
base memory window, so you could use about 450kb. This is not so bad since an instrument
could only be 64k samples long. That again is the entire memory available to the Commodore 64,
so actually, i had quite a nice setup.

To *release an album*, the songs were played in the 
[Inertia Player](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=29208) and recorded to 90 minutes cassette tapes,
relentlessly twisting the volume knob just slightly to simulate a kind of mastering. All of these tapes
have gone to friends and today i can only enjoy my memories and this actual stack of S3M files that were 
still on some old harddrive.

For some records i could reconstruct the intended order of songs from the booklet or a 
still existing listing file. There was much more visual artwork but that seems to be lost.

I hereby release all of it under the *Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0* license.
The non-commercial part comes from the fact that i never earned money with it (although i tried)
so why should you? But, don't hesitate to play it in a club and earn a fee, i'm not a nazi.
